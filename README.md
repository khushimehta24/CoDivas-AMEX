✨Empowering Seamless Transactions, the eZ-RUPI Way!✨
</p>


## Project Description

Traditional payment methods have long suffered from issues of limited accessibility and availability, particularly in the context of executing government welfare schemes and conducting large-scale monetary transactions. These problems have given rise to corruption, a lack of transparency, and the misappropriation of allocated funds. While the introduction of online transactions and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has addressed some of these issues, a significant portion of the rural population still lacks access to bank accounts and reliable internet connectivity. As a result, the money allocated for government scheme beneficiaries often goes astray or falls into the wrong hands due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries. Additionally, some beneficiaries struggle to utilize the funds for their intended purposes.

This problem also extends to corporate companies, which face challenges in efficiently managing employee allowances. While the newly launched e-RUPI system holds promise as a potential solution, the absence of a centralized software platform for managing, distributing, and redeeming e-RUPI vouchers hinders widespread adoption of this digital mechanism in India. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a user-friendly digital payment system that not only streamlines payment processes and enhances transparency but also improves accessibility, ensures accountability, facilitates e-voucher management, and offers offline capabilities.

eZ-RUPI is a product suite we have come up with, creating an ecosystem for e-RUPI Digital Wallet transactions. e-RUPI is the digital payment solution developed with the support of DFS (Department of Financial Services) and NHA (National Health Authority) and is powered by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). eZ-RUPI is more than just a standalone application; it is a comprehensive product suite that has been meticulously crafted to establish a thriving ecosystem for e-RUPI digital wallet transactions. Our aim is to revolutionize the way digital payments are made and bring about a seamless and secure experience for users.
